        A little ahout me: I am born and raised in San Francisco, I am 16 years old and I love my hometown sports teams. 
        My favorite teams are the Giants, Warriors, and 49ers.

      <h3>A high school diploma is not enough</h3>
      <p>
        What matters most, for young adults to build a successful future, is a
        college degree. College graduates are 2 times more likely to be
        employed and they earn 1.6 times more than high school graduates. They
        are more likely to be productive, participating members of society,
        being 2 times more likely to vote and 4.7 times more likely to
        volunteer. And yet, today, 80.5 percent of low-income students DO NOT
        graduate from college.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Over the past 18 years, College Track has demonstrated a record of
        success
      </h3>
      <p>
        Today, 93 percent of our high school students are accepted to
        four-year colleges and our college students graduate at a rate that is
        2.5 times the national average of their low-income* students. In the
        2014-2015 academic year, we served over 2,400 students across eight
        communities. We have six sites in California – East Palo Alto,
        Oakland, San Francisco, Sacramento, the Los Angeles communities of
        Boyle Heights and Watts – a site in the city of New Orleans, and one
        in Aurora, Colorado. In the summer of 2016, we will open our ninth
        site in Denver.
