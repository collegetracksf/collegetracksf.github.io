      <h3>A high school diploma is not enough</h3>
      <p>
        What matters most, for young adults to build a successful future, is a
        college degree. College graduates are 2 times more likely to be
        employed and they earn 1.6 times more than high school graduates. They
        are more likely to be productive, participating members of society,
        being 2 times more likely to vote and 4.7 times more likely to
        volunteer. And yet, today, 80.5 percent of low-income students DO NOT
        graduate from college.
